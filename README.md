# JKWS Maintenance Helper
A must-use plugin I use on all sites, to change some settings, like disabling auto updates.

This is a simple plugin which makes some adjustments to WordPress sites I maintain via [Jos Klever Web Support](https://joskleverwebsupport.nl).
You can use this concept to add your own code snippets, just like I did.

## Installation
There are 2 ways, manual and via MainWP Dashboard.

### Manual
1. Upload the file via (S)FTP or a file manager to /wp-content/mu-plugins/ of the WordPress website.

### Via MainWP Dashboard
1. Use the File Uploader Extension in MainWP Dashboard to choose the file.
2. Enter /mu-plugins/ after the wp-content selection box.
3. Select all the sites you wish to install the file on.
4. Upload the file.
